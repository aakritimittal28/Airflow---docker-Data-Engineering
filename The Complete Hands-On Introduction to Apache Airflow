Project 01 :Â A simple data pipeline

1. Created a table with the Postgres operator 

2. Check whether an API is available. The operator used here will help us wait for some time before moving on to the next task.

3. Extract user

4. Process that user with one of the most popular operator in Airflow.

5. Finally, we store that user in the Postgres database.
